# Express.js Error Handling Improvement

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling. The original code lacks proper error handling, leading to generic error messages that are not helpful for debugging.

The solution includes improved error handling using separate middleware for various error types and providing more detailed error information in the response.
